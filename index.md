## About Me 
My name is Jose Mathew. I'm an Information Technology major in my final year of the program. Born and raised in India, I came to the United States at eight years old. After graduating high school in 2019, I attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach and graduated with a degree in Human Factors Psychology in 2021. My primary career interest has always been in the aviation and aerospace industry. However, I also love computers and wanted to learn coding and tech skills which I figured would help me stand out, so I came to UCF to get an IT degree after completing my first degree. After graduation, I’m looking to land a network engineering position within an aerospace company. Currently, I work part-time at the local Home Depot as a Millwork Specialist. I’ve been working for Home Depot for nearly three years and now have accumulated a wealth of experience from customer service to operating lift equipment. I’ve gone through and learned almost every department at the store including electrical, paint, lumber, appliances, garden, and hardware. As far as my technical skillset, I'm experienced in several UX methods including card sorting, heuristic evaluations, usability testing, and wireframing. I also have experience with research having done survey design, behavioral coding, and qualitative and quantitative data analysis. I’m also experienced with several tools such as Balsamiq, Davinci Resolve, Wix, GitHub, Qualtrics, REBA and RULA among others. I love to learn new skills and expand my library of knowledge, and I always give my all to whatever I may be working on. I can't wait to see where I end up in the future.
