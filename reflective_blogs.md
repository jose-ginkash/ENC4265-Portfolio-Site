# Wayback Analysis: The Home Depot Homepage from April 2011

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DKeRs5N.png"></center>

## First Impressions: 

At first glance, the 2011 Home Depot homepage seems similar to their modern version, but it quickly becomes obvious that it’s lacking the visually engaging design elements of modern websites with a lack of color and contrast. The layout appears cluttered with several sections vying for attention. The whole page lacks polish. 


## Design Choices:

### 1. Navigation Layout:

•	The navigation menu, which is placed horizontally and has drop-down options, is a feature still commonly used today. This version of it however still seems to be early as it’s text-heavy and has minimal use of         color and icons to guide the user. 
   
### 2. Use of Space:

•	They don’t utilize all the space in this layout. There seems to be a lot of white space left over and everything is packed into the middle. 

•	There is way more text compared to images with a reliance on text-heavy sections. 

### 3. Accessibility:

•	The text and font are different from what’s commonly used in modern websites. The font is too small, and the text contrast isn’t the greatest.

•	Many elements of the design are not responsive, which means the page would likely perform poorly on mobile devices.


## My take as a Modern Internet User: 

The Home Depot did a great job on its site for the time. I’ve seen way worse website layouts from the early 2000s that are extremely jarring. Comparatively, while you could tell this was from an earlier era, it wasn’t a completely out-of-place design. That being said, the lack of responsive UI and lack of efficient space optimization felt like a missed opportunity. Navigating the site required more effort as you had to read through a lot of text to understand what you were looking at rather than images and icons. This experience shows how far web design has evolved in terms of aesthetic appeal as well as usability and accessibility. While this version of The Home Depot homepage is functional, the site’s outdated design would struggle to meet the expectations of today’s users.

## Assessment of PCMag’s "How to Build a PC: The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide"
*(https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-build-a-pc-the-ultimate-beginners-guide)*


## Effective Aspects: 

### 1.	Comprehensive Coverage
The guide does an excellent job of walking beginners through each stage of building a PC. It starts with gathering tools and components, then progresses to assembling the system, installing the operating system, and troubleshooting. This step-by-step approach ensures that even those with no prior experience can follow along easily.

### 2.	Clear and Concise Writing
The language is free from excessive technical jargon. When technical terms are used, they are either explained outright or placed in a context that makes their meaning clear. This makes the guide approachable for beginners while still being informative for more experienced users.

### 3.	Use of Visuals
One of the main strengths of this guide is it’s use of images and diagrams. Since PC building is a hands-on process, visuals help clarify instructions and ensure that readers can correctly identify components and their placement.

### 4.	Logical Organization
The article is well structured, starting with preparation before moving into component installation. The progression feels natural, and each section builds upon the last. The user interface of the article/website is very relaxed and doesn’t make unwanted areas pop out. The use of the table of contents is also very nicely implemented to where you can jump to specific sessions at any point in the reading process.  

### 5.	Troubleshooting Section
Many beginner guides focus solely on assembly but fail to prepare users for potential issues. This guide includes troubleshooting advice, which is essential for new builders who might run into problems during or after assembly.


## Ineffective Aspects:

### 1.	Limited Explanation of Component Selection
While the guide provides a general overview of the required components, it could be improved by offering more detailed advice on how to choose the best parts based on the user’s needs such as whether its for gaming, content creation, or office work. A brief discussion of budget considerations or compatibility tools like PCPartPicker would make the guide more useful for those selecting parts for the first time.

### 2.	Lack of Interactive Elements
Since this is an online guide, it could benefit from interactive elements such as embedded videos, expandable FAQs, or links to in-depth component reviews. Many beginner-friendly PC-building guides incorporate video tutorials, which can be more effective than static images in demonstrating complex steps. This site had a huge almost two-hour video tutorial at the very beginning but it would have been effective to embed clips from the video into the specific sections in the guide to where parts of the video are talked about. 

### 3.	Missing Safety Precautions
While the guide does mention gathering tools, it does not emphasize the importance of anti-static precautions such as using an anti-static wrist strap or working on a non-carpeted surface. This is a crucial step for beginners to avoid damaging sensitive components.

### 4.	More Detail on Cable Management
The guide briefly mentions cable management but does not go into enough depth. Good cable management is important for airflow and aesthetics, yet many beginners struggle with it. A dedicated section with tips, examples, or even recommended accessories like Velcro straps or cable routing guides would be beneficial. 

## Final Thoughts:
Overall, this is a well-structured and highly readable guide for beginners looking to build a PC. It covers the essential steps clearly and provides useful troubleshooting tips. With a few refinements, this guide could be an even stronger resource for first-time builders.

# Reflective Blog 4: Prompt F

*Prompt F: Reflect on one of your completed Deliverables for this course. What was easy for you? What was more difficult? Why? What did completing this assignment teach you about yourself and technical communication? What would you do differently based on the instructor's feedback? Note: this one is vintage only, but you can use AI tools for editing.*

## Reflection on My Wayback Analysis Assignment

### Was it easy?
The easiest part of the assignment was formatting the page. I enjoy organizing information clearly, so using headings, bullet points, and images came naturally. Dr. Johnson's positive feedback on this reassured me that my approach to structure and readability was effective.

### What Was Difficult?
The most challenging part was analyzing the website objectively. While I had my own immediate reactions to the outdated design, I had to think critically about why those elements felt out of place rather than just stating my preferences. It required me to step back and compare the old website with modern standards in a more analytical way.

### What Did I Learn About Myself and Technical Communication?
This assignment reinforced the importance of clarity and conciseness in technical communication. I learned that effective analysis isn’t just about identifying issues. It’s about explaining them in a structured way that is accessible to any reader. It also showed me that small design choices, like bolding certain parts and layout, can have a significant impact on user experience.

### What Would I Do Differently?
Since Dr. Johnson's feedback was entirely positive, I wouldn’t make major changes to my approach. However, if I were to improve the assignment, I might include more direct comparisons to the modern Home Depot homepage. This could further emphasize how web design standards have evolved. Overall, completing the Wayback Analysis assignment was an interesting experience that helped me better understand both web design evolution and technical communication better.

# Reflective Blog 5: Prompt A

*Prompt A: Reflect on your assigned reading this week in a detailed manner that demonstrates you read and understood the assigned reading. What can you 'take away' from this reading? What insightful concepts did you read about that can inform your own technical communication activities?*

## Reflection on This Week’s Reading (Week H)

This week’s readings, including Chapter 9 and Interlude 3, focused on how to create clear and user-friendly content, especially for online platforms. Both chapters explain how writing for the web is different from traditional writing and how adjusting to this new format can help engage readers and make information easier to understand. 

One key point from Chapter 9 is the use of headings to make content more skimmable. Good headings help readers quickly find the information they need without having to read everything. The chapter shares tips for writing effective headings, suggesting that it’s better to use questions, statements, or action phrases rather than vague terms. I found the advice about maintaining a consistent style for headings particularly helpful. I understood it as when headings look similar, they’re simpler to follow. Additionally, I learned that including relevant keywords in headings can make the content easier to find online, which is essential for reaching a wider audience. 

Interlude 3 builds on these ideas by discussing how press releases have changed in the digital world. Traditionally, press releases were aimed at journalists, but now they often serve a wider audience as online content. This reading highlights the importance of formatting press releases in a way that suits web readers, meaning, use clear headings, short paragraphs, bullet points, and links to additional information. It was interesting to discover that many people see press releases not just as promotional materials, but as reliable sources of information. This change means organizations need to write press releases with everyday readers in mind, not just for media professionals.  

Overall, both readings offer useful advice for anyone involved in writing or sharing information. Whether it’s a web article, a press release, or an instruction manual, organizing content well can make it more enjoyable and easier to digest. For my own writing from now on, I plan to be more mindful of how I structure it, ensuring it’s easy to read, accessible, and includes meaningful headings. I’ll also think about how my writing will be used in different situations such as whether it’s a standalone document, part of a website, or something shared on social media. These insights will guide me in creating clearer and more effective documents in the future.

# Reflective Blog 6: Prompt E

*Prompt E: Analyze a chatbot (e.g., customer service, virtual assistant). Spend at least 5 minutes interacting with it & exploring its functionality. Then, reflect on the bot's: purpose (What is the chatbot designed to do?, functionality (how well does it perform its tasks?), user experience (was it easy to use? What were the strengths and weaknesses?), and context (how does it benefit users and the organization?)*

## Analysis of Home Depot's Magic Apron Chatbot

### Purpose
The Magic Apron chatbot is designed to assist Home Depot customers with product inquiries, DIY project guidance, and general customer service questions. It aims to provide quick, accessible answers about Home Depot’s offerings, including product recommendations, installation services, and purchasing options. Given that it is in beta, the chatbot appears to be in a trial phase where its effectiveness is being tested and refined.

### Functionality
While the chatbot performs well with pre-selected questions and structured questions, it struggles with more complex or open-ended ones. When asked general or multi-part questions, it often fails to respond properly, giving an error message stating, “An error occurred while processing your request.” This shows a limitation in its ability to handle natural language input and more detailed problem-solving. Additionally, its responses frequently mirror product descriptions rather than providing personalized answers or actual advice, making it feel more like an automated product catalog than a knowledgeable assistant.

### User Experience
Interacting with Magic Apron is straightforward, especially when selecting from the chatbot’s suggested questions. For those looking for basic product details or general guidance, the chatbot provides clear and structured responses. However, its weaknesses become apparent when users deviate from its preset options. The frequent error messages make it frustrating to use for more in-depth inquiries, and its tendency to provide sales-oriented responses rather than tailored advice reduces its usefulness. Strengths include quick access to product information and concise responses, but the bot’s lack of flexibility and failure to handle complex interactions negatively impact the user experience.

### Context
For customers, the Magic Apron chatbot serves as a quick reference tool for basic home improvement questions and product inquiries, potentially saving time compared to searching manually on the website. However, its current limitations mean that users may still need to speak with a human associate for more complicated issues. For Home Depot, the chatbot helps automate customer interactions, reducing the workload for human representatives and potentially improving efficiency. However, its beta-phase problems show that further improvements are needed before it can reliably enhance customer service.

### Conclusion
Overall, Home Depot’s Magic Apron chatbot shows promise in providing quick product-related responses but falls short in handling complex inquiries. Its tendency to give  pre-structured responses and product descriptions limits its versatility, and the frequent error messages hinder usability. If improved, it could become a valuable tool for both customers and Home Depot, but as of now, it requires significant enhancements to provide a truly effective and seamless user experience.

# Reflective Blog 7: Prompt R

*Prompt R: After you have completed the Chatbot assignment or any assignment using AI for most of the work, reflect on your interaction with this emerging technology: What does AI do well? What does it not do well? What did you have to correct or re-prompt it to modify? What can you know about its training data? What kinds of data was included? What kinds of data was excluded? What do you think the future holds as this technology is used and further advanced?*

## Analysis of my Linus Chatbot

After working on my chatbot assignment, I had some interesting experiences interacting with the AI. My chatbot, Linus, was designed to help with PC building, and I based him on Linus from Linus Tech Tips. The only information I gave him was the PCMag Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Building PCs, so I was curious to see how well he could help me.

### What did it do well?
One thing AI does really well is generating responses quickly and making them sound engaging. Linus had a fun personality and made the conversation feel lively, which made asking for help more enjoyable. He also gave useful suggestions for PC parts and troubleshooting steps, which were mostly accurate.

### What did it not do well?
However, AI has its limits. While Linus provided good recommendations, he sometimes needed more clarification or re-prompting to get the best results. For example, when I asked about building a white-themed PC, he gave me a solid build, but when I removed the color requirement, he was able to suggest an even better build for the same price. This showed me that AI can be flexible but sometimes needs guidance to reach the best answer.

### What did you have to correct or re-prompt it to modify? 
Another issue was that Linus didn’t always consider local availability. Since I mentioned shopping at Micro Center, I had to double-check whether the suggested parts were actually in stock. AI also doesn’t always understand context perfectly. For example, it didn’t immediately recognize that my PC shutting down at the Windows loading screen was likely a thermal issue until I gave more details.

### What kind of data was included or excluded? 
When it comes to training data, AI models are trained on a mix of publicly available information, licensed data, and information from books and websites. This means they can be really knowledgeable about general topics like PC building, but they might miss specific or recent information. Also, certain data, like personal opinions or proprietary details, might be excluded, so AI can’t always provide the most up-to-date recommendations. The only data that was given to this model was the guide on PC building written by PCMag. Everything else was what the model itself knew. 

### What does the future hold? 
Looking ahead, AI is only going to get better. As models improve, they’ll likely be able to provide more accurate and personalized advice, possibly even pulling in real-time data about stock availability or pricing. They might also get better at recognizing user intent without needing as much clarification. However, there will always be challenges, like avoiding misinformation and ensuring AI understands complex problems fully.

### Conclusion
Overall, working with AI for this project was a fun and useful experience. While it’s not perfect, it’s a great tool for brainstorming and troubleshooting, and I was already blown away by how natural and useful it felt to go back and forth with it. I can’t wait to see how much more powerful a resource it will become in the future.
