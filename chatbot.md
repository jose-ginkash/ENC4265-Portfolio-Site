# Chatbot: [Linus (inspired by Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips)](https://box.boodle.ai/a/@PCBuildPro)

I designed my interactive AI assistant to help users navigate the often-intimidating world of PC building and troubleshooting. While I designed the bot with the main purpose of helping a new user pick parts and build a PC, it has the technical knowledge and ability to do much more. 

Built using BoodleBox AI and powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, this bot combines technical knowledge with an engaging and entertaining personality modeled after Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips. Whether users are assembling their first gaming rig, diagnosing a stubborn hardware issue, or seeking advice on the best components for their budget, the chatbot provides step-by-step guidance, practical recommendations, and lots of tech humor to keep the experience both educational and enjoyable. (Just like Linus)

The bot operates through a structured workflow, beginning with an enthusiastic greeting and an assessment of the user’s needs. It then responds based on the user’s goals. It can offer compatibility checks, troubleshooting assistance, and best practices for PC maintenance and upgrades. The bot explains technical jargon in accessible terms, uses analogies to simplify complex concepts, and prioritizes safety considerations like static electricity precautions and power supply selection.  

The chatbot makes building and maintaining a PC easier and genuinely fun, appealing to both beginners and seasoned enthusiasts alike. Start your PC Building journey with [Linus](https://box.boodle.ai/a/@PCBuildPro).
