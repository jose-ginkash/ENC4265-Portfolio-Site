They are written in a highly structured format that condenses a wealth of data into just a few lines. While this format is efficient, it can also be intimidating to new pilots or anyone unfamiliar with aviation weather codes.

This manual is designed to **break down the complexity** of METARs and TAFs into easily understandable pieces. Whether you're a student pilot, a simulator enthusiast, or simply someone interested in how pilots interpret the skies, this guide will help you:

- Understand the structure and components of METARs and TAFs
- Decode real-world examples step-by-step
- Learn why each part of the report matters

Throughout this manual, you'll find **annotated examples**, **visuals**, and **explanations of both the how and the why** behind each step of decoding these essential tools.

Ready to begin? Let’s start with METARs—the most commonly used aviation weather report.


# Understanding METARs: The Basics

## What is a METAR?

A **METAR** is an aviation routine weather report. Issued at least once an hour, it provides a snapshot of current weather conditions at a specific location, usually an airport. METARs are essential for **preflight planning** and **in-flight decision-making** because they inform pilots about visibility, wind, temperature, cloud cover, and other safety-critical factors.

## Where Do METARs Come From?

METARs are produced by **meteorological observers** or **automated weather systems** located at airports. In the U.S., they're primarily generated by the **National Weather Service (NWS)** and are distributed globally through aviation weather networks.

You can find METARs on websites such as:
- [aviationweather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov/metar)
- [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com/)
- [ForeFlight App](https://foreflight.com)

## METAR Format Overview

METARs follow a standardized international format set by the **International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)**. Here’s a sample METAR:

- METAR KMCO 081753Z 09010KT 10SM FEW035 SCT050 BKN090 28/21 A2992 RMK AO2 SLP132

At first glance, this might look like a jumble of letters and numbers, but each group has a specific meaning. The following sections will break this down step by step so that you’ll be able to read and understand these reports with confidence.

# Breaking Down a METAR (Section by Section)

Let’s decode the following sample METAR line to understand what each group means:

- METAR KMCO 081753Z 09010KT 10SM FEW035 SCT050 BKN090 28/21 A2992 RMK AO2 SLP132

Each group of characters gives a specific piece of weather information. Here's how to read it section by section:

---

## 1. Report Type and Station Identifier

**METAR KMCO**

- **METAR** – Routine hourly weather report  
- **KMCO** – ICAO identifier for the reporting station (Orlando International Airport)

> ICAO codes are four-letter airport identifiers. In the U.S., they always begin with "K".  
> Examples: KLAX (Los Angeles), KATL (Atlanta), KDEN (Denver)

---

## 2. Date and Time of Report

**081753Z**

- **08** – Day of the month  
- **1753Z** – Time of observation in Zulu (UTC) time: 17:53 Z

> Pilots use Zulu time to avoid confusion across time zones.

---

## 3. Wind

**09010KT**

- **090** – Wind is coming *from* 090 degrees (East)  
- **10KT** – Wind speed is 10 knots

> Gusts are indicated like this: **09010G18KT**  
> That means winds from 090° at 10 knots, gusting to 18 knots.

---

## 4. Visibility

**10SM**

- Visibility is 10 statute miles or more

> In U.S. METARs, visibility is in **statute miles (SM)**.  
> In international METARs, **“9999”** means 10 kilometers or more.

---

# 5. Sky Conditions

**FEW035 SCT050 BKN090**

Sky conditions are reported from least to most coverage:

- **FEW035** – Few clouds at 3,500 feet above ground level (AGL)  
- **SCT050** – Scattered clouds at 5,000 feet AGL  
- **BKN090** – Broken cloud layer at 9,000 feet AGL

> Cloud coverage codes:
> - **FEW** = Few (1–2 oktas)
> - **SCT** = Scattered (3–4 oktas)
> - **BKN** = Broken (5–7 oktas)
> - **OVC** = Overcast (8 oktas)

> Cloud heights are always in hundreds of feet above ground level.

---

# 6. Temperature and Dew Point

**28/21**

- **28°C** – Temperature  
- **21°C** – Dew point

> If temperatures are below freezing, they appear with an “M” (e.g., **M05** = -5°C)

> A smaller gap between temperature and dew point indicates higher humidity, which can lead to fog or low cloud development.

---

# 7. Altimeter Setting

**A2992**

- **A** = Altimeter setting in inches of mercury (inHg)  
- **2992** = 29.92 inHg

> Used to calibrate the aircraft's altimeter to ensure accurate altitude readings.

---

# Understanding TAFs: Aviation Forecasts

## What is a TAF?

A **TAF** (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) is an aviation weather forecast that predicts the weather conditions for an airport over a 24 or 30-hour period (or 9 hours for some countries). While METARs provide real-time observations of current weather conditions, TAFs give pilots **forecasted weather** to help with flight planning, especially for takeoff, approach, and landing.

TAFs are typically issued every 6 hours and are meant to provide a general idea of expected weather. However, **weather can change**, so pilots must stay updated and monitor METARs in conjunction with TAFs during flight.

---

## TAF Format Overview

Just like METARs, TAFs follow a standard format. Here's a sample TAF:

- TAF KMCO 081730Z 0818/0924 09010KT P6SM SCT050 BKN090


In this example:
- **TAF** – Forecast report
- **KMCO** – Station identifier (Orlando International Airport)
- **081730Z** – Report issued on the 8th at 17:30 Z
- **0818/0924** – Forecast period from 18:00Z on the 8th to 24:00Z on the 9th
- **09010KT** – Wind forecast from 090° at 10 knots
- **P6SM** – Visibility greater than 6 statute miles
- **SCT050** – Scattered clouds at 5,000 feet AGL
- **BKN090** – Broken clouds at 9,000 feet AGL

---

# Breaking Down a TAF (Section by Section)

Let’s take a look at the following sample TAF and break it down:

- TAF KMCO 081730Z 0818/0924 09010KT P6SM SCT050 BKN090

---

## 1. Report Type and Station Identifier

**TAF KMCO**

- **TAF** – Terminal Aerodrome Forecast  
- **KMCO** – ICAO code for Orlando International Airport

> **Note**: The format is the same as METAR, but this is a forecast, not a current observation.

---

## 2. Date and Time of Report

**081730Z**

- **08** – Day of the month  
- **1730Z** – Time of report in Zulu (UTC) time: 17:30 Z

> Just like METARs, TAFs use **Zulu time (UTC)** to avoid confusion with time zones.

---

## 3. Forecast Period

**0818/0924**

- **0818** – Forecast start time: 18:00Z on the 8th  
- **0924** – Forecast end time: 24:00Z on the 9th

> The TAF covers a 24-hour period (or up to 30 hours in some cases). The times indicate when the forecast period starts and ends.

---

## 4. Wind Forecast

**09010KT**

- **090** – Wind forecast from 090° (East)  
- **10KT** – Wind speed forecast at 10 knots

> The format for wind is the same as in METARs. Wind gusts are included if there are any changes in wind speed, similar to **METAR** format.

---

## 5. Visibility

**P6SM**

- **P6SM** – Visibility forecast **greater than 6 statute miles**

> "P" indicates that the visibility is forecast to be greater than 6 statute miles. If the visibility were less than 6 miles, the forecast would include a specific number (e.g., **6SM**).

---

# Sky Conditions in a TAF

**SCT050 BKN090**

- **SCT050** – Scattered clouds at 5,000 feet AGL  
- **BKN090** – Broken clouds at 9,000 feet AGL

> **Sky condition codes** in TAFs are similar to those in METARs:
> - **FEW** – Few clouds (1–2 oktas)
> - **SCT** – Scattered clouds (3–4 oktas)
> - **BKN** – Broken clouds (5–7 oktas)
> - **OVC** – Overcast (8 oktas)

> Cloud heights are always measured in hundreds of feet AGL. The forecast indicates the highest cloud layers, but these conditions could change throughout the forecast period.

---

## Temperature in a TAF

- TAFs do not always include temperature information. If it is provided, it appears as **TEMP** in the format:  
  `TEMP 15 18`, meaning the temperature will rise from 15°C to 18°C during the forecast period.

> While temperature is more commonly found in METARs, TAFs are more focused on **winds, visibility, and sky conditions**. However, knowing the expected temperature can be helpful for estimating other conditions like freezing levels.

---

## Remarks

**No remarks section in this example**

- **Remarks** in TAFs are optional and are used to provide additional information, like changes in weather conditions or operational information (e.g., runway conditions).
- If present, the remarks section is usually at the end of the TAF forecast.

> Example of remarks:  
> `RMK AO2` – Automated station with precipitation sensor  
> `RMK SLP013` – Sea-level pressure is 1013 hPa

---

## Summary: TAF Breakdown Recap

> **TAF KMCO 081730Z 0818/0924 09010KT P6SM SCT050 BKN090**

## TAF vs METAR: Key Differences

- **METARs** provide current conditions (updated every hour or as needed).
- **TAFs** provide a forecast (usually every 6 hours) for a set period (24 or 30 hours).

In a TAF, the weather can change over time, and the forecast is updated regularly, while the METAR reflects the weather at the time of observation.

---
# Interpreting METARs and TAFs Together

When planning a flight, pilots must utilize both **METARs** and **TAFs** to get a full picture of current and forecasted weather conditions. While METARs provide real-time data, TAFs offer the forecast, and together they form a complete understanding of what to expect at an airport.

### How to Use METARs and TAFs Together

1. **METARs for Current Conditions:**
   - METARs are essential for understanding the **current** weather at the departure, en route, and arrival airports.  
   - They show the **exact weather** at the time the report was issued (usually every hour, or as needed).
   
2. **TAFs for Forecasted Conditions:**
   - TAFs provide the **forecasted** weather over the next 24 to 30 hours, making them crucial for flight planning.
   - Pilots use TAFs to anticipate changes in the weather, such as wind direction and speed, visibility, and sky conditions, during different phases of the flight.

### Example: Using METAR and TAF Together

Let’s look at an example for **Orlando International Airport (KMCO)**. We’ll combine a METAR and a TAF to see how a pilot might use both reports:

#### METAR: METAR KMCO 081753Z 09010KT 10SM FEW035 SCT050 BKN090 28/21 A2992 RMK AO2 SLP132


- **Current conditions**:
  - Wind from 090° at 10 knots
  - Visibility: 10 statute miles
  - Sky conditions: Few clouds at 3,500 feet, scattered clouds at 5,000 feet, broken clouds at 9,000 feet
  - Temperature: 28°C, Dew point: 21°C
  - Altimeter: 29.92 inHg

#### TAF: TAF KMCO 081730Z 0818/0924 09010KT P6SM SCT050 BKN090

- **Forecasted conditions**:
  - Wind forecast from 090° at 10 knots
  - Visibility forecast: Greater than 6 statute miles
  - Sky conditions: Scattered clouds at 5,000 feet, broken clouds at 9,000 feet

### How to Combine Both Reports

- **Current weather (from METAR)**:
  - The METAR shows that at the time of observation (17:53Z), the sky conditions are a mix of few, scattered, and broken clouds with 10SM visibility. The wind is mild at 10 knots from the east. This is favorable for takeoff and approach.
  
- **Forecasted weather (from TAF)**:
  - The TAF for the period between **18:00Z** and **24:00Z** confirms similar conditions, with scattered clouds at 5,000 feet and broken clouds at 9,000 feet. There’s no indication of major changes in weather during this period, so a pilot can expect relatively stable conditions.

#### Why Use Both?

- **METARs** tell the pilot what to expect **right now**.
- **TAFs** provide a forecast of what the weather will likely be over the next several hours.
- Using both helps pilots make critical decisions, especially when conditions are rapidly changing or if they're unsure about the weather conditions at their destination.
