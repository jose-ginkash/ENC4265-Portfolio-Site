# Wayback Analysis: The Home Depot Homepage from April 2011

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DKeRs5N.png"></center>

## First Impressions: 

At first glance, the 2011 Home Depot homepage seems similar to their modern version, but it quickly becomes obvious that it’s lacking the visually engaging design elements of modern websites with a lack of color and contrast. The layout appears cluttered with several sections vying for attention. The whole page lacks polish. 


## Design Choices:

### 1. Navigation Layout:

•	The navigation menu, which is placed horizontally and has drop-down options, is a feature still commonly used today. This version of it however still seems to be early as it’s text-heavy and has minimal use of         color and icons to guide the user. 
   
### 2. Use of Space:

•	They don’t utilize all the space in this layout. There seems to be a lot of white space left over and everything is packed into the middle. 

•	There is way more text compared to images with a reliance on text-heavy sections. 

### 3. Accessibility:

•	The text and font are different from what’s commonly used in modern websites. The font is too small, and the text contrast isn’t the greatest.

•	Many elements of the design are not responsive, which means the page would likely perform poorly on mobile devices.


## My take as a Modern Internet User: 

The Home Depot did a great job on its site for the time. I’ve seen way worse website layouts from the early 2000s that are extremely jarring. Comparatively, while you could tell this was from an earlier era, it wasn’t a completely out-of-place design. That being said, the lack of responsive UI and lack of efficient space optimization felt like a missed opportunity. Navigating the site required more effort as you had to read through a lot of text to understand what you were looking at rather than images and icons. This experience shows how far web design has evolved in terms of aesthetic appeal as well as usability and accessibility. While this version of The Home Depot homepage is functional, the site’s outdated design would struggle to meet the expectations of today’s users.

# Quick Start Guide: Connecting to a public AdGuard DNS Server

## Product Introduction: 
Ads have become more intrusive no matter what we might be trying to do on the internet. YouTube will usually have multiple ads per video with some not letting you skip. You can't even read a simple news article without being berated by several ads with every scroll you take. On a desktop or laptop, it's pretty easy to get rid of ads. You simply get an AdBlock extension for the browser of your choosing and it works as simple as that. On phones, however, it’s a lot more complicated. Most of the main solutions are to download some kind of app but most of the apps that work, require you to pay for it. It’s not possible to get extensions on mobile browsers, as you could on Chrome on a desktop or laptop. That’s where this method comes in. It’s simple and free and eliminates most ads on mobile devices. 

### Disclaimer: 
•	AdGuard DNS servers are not like your typical software's where you have to download something. You just have to connect to it. 

•	This tutorial is for a Samsung Galaxy S23+ with Android Version 14. The following steps might be slightly different for other Android versions/phones. The general steps should still be apply, even if the exact order is different. 

**Prerequisites:** Must have an Android. (This method only works on Android phones.)

### Steps:
1. Open your Phone’s settings.

   </p>
   <p align="center"><em>Select the restart Option</em></p>


## Congratulations! 
After restarting your phone, you can enjoy browsing through your phone with no ads. This does not get rid of ads in applications such as YouTube or streaming apps. It only affects browsing through the internet whether it be through Chrome, Firefox, or the default web browser app for your phone. There’s no more risk of pop-up ads and risking accidental viruses by clicking the wrong link on the wrong site. It will also block trackers.
