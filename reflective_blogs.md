# Wayback Analysis: The Home Depot Homepage from April 2011

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DKeRs5N.png"></center>

## First Impressions: 

At first glance, the 2011 Home Depot homepage seems similar to their modern version, but it quickly becomes obvious that it’s lacking the visually engaging design elements of modern websites with a lack of color and contrast. The layout appears cluttered with several sections vying for attention. The whole page lacks polish. 


## Design Choices:

### 1. Navigation Layout:

•	The navigation menu, which is placed horizontally and has drop-down options, is a feature still commonly used today. This version of it however still seems to be early as it’s text-heavy and has minimal use of         color and icons to guide the user. 
   
### 2. Use of Space:

•	They don’t utilize all the space in this layout. There seems to be a lot of white space left over and everything is packed into the middle. 

•	There is way more text compared to images with a reliance on text-heavy sections. 

### 3. Accessibility:

•	The text and font are different from what’s commonly used in modern websites. The font is too small, and the text contrast isn’t the greatest.

•	Many elements of the design are not responsive, which means the page would likely perform poorly on mobile devices.


## My take as a Modern Internet User: 

The Home Depot did a great job on its site for the time. I’ve seen way worse website layouts from the early 2000s that are extremely jarring. Comparatively, while you could tell this was from an earlier era, it wasn’t a completely out-of-place design. That being said, the lack of responsive UI and lack of efficient space optimization felt like a missed opportunity. Navigating the site required more effort as you had to read through a lot of text to understand what you were looking at rather than images and icons. This experience shows how far web design has evolved in terms of aesthetic appeal as well as usability and accessibility. While this version of The Home Depot homepage is functional, the site’s outdated design would struggle to meet the expectations of today’s users.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
