# Introduction

In aviation, weather is one of the most critical factors affecting flight safety. Pilots must make informed decisions before and during flight, and to do that, they rely heavily on concise, standardized weather reports known as **METARs** and **TAFs**.

These weather reports provide real-time and forecasted meteorological conditions for specific locations—primarily airports. They are written in a highly structured format that condenses a wealth of data into just a few lines. While this format is efficient, it can also be intimidating to new pilots or anyone unfamiliar with aviation weather codes.

This manual is designed to break down the complexity of METARs and TAFs into easily understandable pieces. Whether you're a student pilot, a simulator enthusiast, or simply someone interested in how pilots interpret the skies, this guide will help you:

- Understand the structure and components of METARs and TAFs
- Decode real-world examples step-by-step
- Learn why each part of the report matters

Throughout this manual, you'll find annotated examples, visuals, and explanations of both the how and the why behind each step of decoding these essential tools.

Ready to begin? Let’s start with METARs—the most commonly used aviation weather report.


# Understanding METARs: The Basics

## What is a METAR?

A **METAR** is an aviation routine weather report. Issued at least once an hour, it provides a snapshot of current weather conditions at a specific location, usually an airport. METARs are essential for **preflight planning** and **in-flight decision-making** because they inform pilots about visibility, wind, temperature, cloud cover, and other safety-critical factors.

## Where Do METARs Come From?

METARs are produced by **meteorological observers** or **automated weather systems** located at airports. In the U.S., they're primarily generated by the **National Weather Service (NWS)** and are distributed globally through aviation weather networks.

You can find METARs on websites such as:
- [aviationweather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov/gfa/#obs)
- [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com/)
- [ForeFlight App](https://foreflight.com)

## METAR Format Overview

METARs follow a standardized international format set by the **International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)**. Here’s a sample METAR:

- METAR KMCO 081753Z 09010KT 10SM FEW035 SCT050 BKN090 28/21 A2992 RMK AO2 SLP132

At first glance, this might look like a jumble of letters and numbers, but each group has a specific meaning. The following sections will break this down step by step so that you’ll be able to read and understand these reports with confidence.

- **SCT050** – Scattered clouds at 5,000 feet AGL  
- **BKN090** – Broken cloud layer at 9,000 feet AGL

> Cloud coverage codes:
> - **FEW** = Few (1–2 oktas)
> - **SCT** = Scattered (3–4 oktas)
> - **BKN** = Broken (5–7 oktas)
> - **OVC** = Overcast (8 oktas)

> Cloud heights are always in hundreds of feet above ground level.

---

## Temperature and Dew Point

**28/21**

- **28°C** – Temperature  
- **21°C** – Dew point

> If temperatures are below freezing, they appear with an “M” (e.g., **M05** = -5°C)

> A smaller gap between temperature and dew point indicates higher humidity, which can lead to fog or low cloud development.

---

## Altimeter (Pressure) 

**A2992**

- **A** = Altimeter setting in inches of mercury (inHg)  
- **2992** = 29.92 inHg

# Understanding TAFs: The Basics

## What is a TAF?

A **TAF** (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) is an aviation weather forecast that predicts the weather conditions for an airport over a 24 or 30-hour period (or 9 hours for some countries). While METARs provide real-time observations of current weather conditions, TAFs give pilots **forecasted weather** to help with flight planning, especially for takeoff, approach, and landing.

TAFs are typically issued every 6 hours and are meant to provide a general idea of expected weather. However, **weather can change**, so pilots must stay updated and monitor METARs in conjunction with TAFs during flight.

## Where Do TAFs Come From?

**TAFs (Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts)** are issued by certified meteorologists working at designated weather forecast offices around the world. In the United States, most TAFs are generated by the **National Weather Service (NWS)**, specifically from **Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs)** and **Center Weather Service Units (CWSUs)**, which provide aviation-focused forecasts.

Globally, the issuance of TAFs is regulated by the **International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)**, ensuring a standardized format and distribution system that pilots and dispatchers can rely on no matter the country. Each TAF is typically prepared and updated every six hours and is valid for a period ranging from 24 to 30 hours, depending on the airport's operational importance.

TAFs are disseminated through various aviation weather services, such as the **Aviation Weather Center (AWC)**, **Flight Service Stations (FSS)**, and electronic flight planning systems. They're also automatically included in flight briefing packages provided to pilots by dispatchers or apps like ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot.

In essence, TAFs are the product of meteorological expertise, forecasting models, and global coordination—all aimed at helping pilots plan safely and effectively for future weather conditions.

You can find TAFs on the same websites as METARs:
- [aviationweather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov/gfa/#obs)
- [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com/)
- [ForeFlight App](https://foreflight.com)
  
## TAF Format Overview

Just like METARs, TAFs follow a standard format. Here's a sample TAF:

- TAF KMCO 081730Z 0818/0924 09010KT P6SM SCT050 BKN090

---

# Breaking Down a TAF (Section by Section)

Let’s take a look at the following sample TAF and break it down:

- TAF KMCO 081730Z 0818/0924 09010KT P6SM SCT050 BKN090

---

# Report Type and Station Identifier

**TAF KMCO**

- **TAF** – Terminal Aerodrome Forecast  
- **KMCO** – ICAO code for Orlando International Airport

> **Note**: The format is the same as METAR, but this is a forecast, not a current observation.

---

# Date and Time of Report

**081730Z**

- **08** – Day of the month  
- **1730Z** – Time of report in Zulu (UTC) time: 17:30 Z

> Just like METARs, TAFs use **Zulu time (UTC)** to avoid confusion with time zones.

---

## Forecast Period

**0818/0924**

- **0818** – Forecast start time: 18:00Z on the 8th  
- **0924** – Forecast end time: 24:00Z on the 9th

> The TAF covers a 24-hour period (or up to 30 hours in some cases). The times indicate when the forecast period starts and ends.

---

## Wind Forecast

**09010KT**

- **090** – Wind forecast from 090° (East)  
- **10KT** – Wind speed forecast at 10 knots

> The format for wind is the same as in METARs. Wind gusts are included if there are any changes in wind speed, similar to **METAR** format.

---

## Visibility

**P6SM**

- **P6SM** – Visibility forecast **greater than 6 statute miles**

> "P" indicates that the visibility is forecast to be greater than 6 statute miles. If the visibility were less than 6 miles, the forecast would include a specific number (e.g., **6SM**).

---

## Sky Conditions

**SCT050 BKN090**

- **SCT050** – Scattered clouds at 5,000 feet AGL  
- **BKN090** – Broken clouds at 9,000 feet AGL

> **Sky condition codes** in TAFs are similar to those in METARs:
> - **FEW** – Few clouds (1–2 oktas)
> - **SCT** – Scattered clouds (3–4 oktas)
> - **BKN** – Broken clouds (5–7 oktas)
> - **OVC** – Overcast (8 oktas)

> Cloud heights are always measured in hundreds of feet AGL. The forecast indicates the highest cloud layers, but these conditions could change throughout the forecast period.

---

## Temperature 

- TAFs do not always include temperature information. If it is provided, it appears as **TEMP** in the format:  
  `TEMP 15 18`, meaning the temperature will rise from 15°C to 18°C during the forecast period.

> While temperature is more commonly found in METARs, TAFs are more focused on **winds, visibility, and sky conditions**. However, knowing the expected temperature can be helpful for estimating other conditions like freezing levels.

---

## Remarks

**No remarks section in this example**

- **Remarks** in TAFs are optional and are used to provide additional information, like changes in weather conditions or operational information (e.g., runway conditions).
- If present, the remarks section is usually at the end of the TAF forecast.

> Example of remarks:  
> `RMK AO2` – Automated station with precipitation sensor  
> `RMK SLP013` – Sea-level pressure is 1013 hPa

---

## Summary

Let’s recap what the full decoded TAF tells us:

> **TAF KMCO 081730Z 0818/0924 09010KT P6SM SCT050 BKN090**

- **TAF** – Forecast report for Orlando International Airport (KMCO)
- Issued on **08th at 17:30 Z**
- Forecast period from **18:00Z on the 8th to 24:00Z on the 9th**
- **Wind** from 090° at 10 knots

TAFs provide a forecast of **future weather conditions** for airports, helping pilots make decisions for flight planning.

---

## METARs vs TAFs: Key Differences

- **METARs** provide current conditions (updated every hour or as needed).
- **TAFs** provide a forecast (usually every 6 hours) for a set period (24 or 30 hours).

In a TAF, the weather can change over time, and the forecast is updated regularly, while the METAR reflects the weather at the time of observation.

---
# Interpreting METARs and TAFs Together

When planning a flight, pilots must utilize both **METARs** and **TAFs** to get a full picture of current and forecasted weather conditions. While METARs provide real-time data, TAFs offer the forecast, and together they form a complete understanding of what to expect at an airport.

### How to Use METARs and TAFs Together

1. **METARs for Current Conditions:**
   - METARs are essential for understanding the **current** weather at the departure, en route, and arrival airports.  
   - They show the **exact weather** at the time the report was issued (usually every hour, or as needed).
   
2. **TAFs for Forecasted Conditions:**
   - TAFs provide the **forecasted** weather over the next 24 to 30 hours, making them crucial for flight planning.
   - Pilots use TAFs to anticipate changes in the weather, such as wind direction and speed, visibility, and sky conditions, during different phases of the flight.

### Example: Using METARs and TAFs Together

Let’s look at an example for **Orlando International Airport (KMCO)**. We’ll combine a METAR and a TAF to see how a pilot might use both reports:

#### METAR: METAR KMCO 081753Z 09010KT 10SM FEW035 SCT050 BKN090 28/21 A2992 RMK AO2 SLP132


- **Current conditions**:
  - Wind from 090° at 10 knots
  - Visibility: 10 statute miles
  - Sky conditions: Few clouds at 3,500 feet, scattered clouds at 5,000 feet, broken clouds at 9,000 feet
  - Temperature: 28°C, Dew point: 21°C
  - Altimeter: 29.92 inHg

#### TAF: TAF KMCO 081730Z 0818/0924 09010KT P6SM SCT050 BKN090

- **Forecasted conditions**:
  - Wind forecast from 090° at 10 knots
  - Visibility forecast: Greater than 6 statute miles
  - Sky conditions: Scattered clouds at 5,000 feet, broken clouds at 9,000 feet

### How to Combine Both Reports

- **Current weather (from METAR)**:
  - The METAR shows that at the time of observation (17:53Z), the sky conditions are a mix of few, scattered, and broken clouds with 10SM visibility. The wind is mild at 10 knots from the east. This is favorable for takeoff and approach.
  
- **Forecasted weather (from TAF)**:
  - The TAF for the period between **18:00Z** and **24:00Z** confirms similar conditions, with scattered clouds at 5,000 feet and broken clouds at 9,000 feet. There’s no indication of major changes in weather during this period, so a pilot can expect relatively stable conditions.

#### Why Use Both?

- **METARs** tell the pilot what to expect **right now**.
- **TAFs** provide a forecast of what the weather will likely be over the next several hours.
- Using both helps pilots make critical decisions, especially when conditions are rapidly changing or if they're unsure about the weather conditions at their destination.

---

## Summary

By reading and interpreting **both METARs and TAFs**, pilots can assess the **current weather conditions** as well as **forecasted weather** to help with flight planning. METARs are useful for immediate decisions like takeoff or landing, while TAFs provide insight into what will happen over the next few hours, aiding in long-term flight planning and adjustment.
